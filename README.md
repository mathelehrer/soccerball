A warning at the beginning

This is not meant to be a platform independent or standalone version.
It is working code that was used for the specific simulations.

It relies on pre-installed versions of 
povray
ffmpeg

as well as writing access and bash functionality.

The main tweaking of parameters is performed in the ModelSoccerball class.
The file name is set in the class GuiSoccerball. Besides the povray rendering,
there is a simple 2d projection of the scene onto a canvas.
